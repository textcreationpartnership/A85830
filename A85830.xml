            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And indeed, Sir, this may well the rather be deemed ſo to be, becauſe you appear plainly ſo puzzled in that which enſues; that you ſhuffell much, and maſh your ſelf like a <hi>fiſh</hi> in a <hi>net</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Which, howſoever part, of it be true, and part of it moſt falſe;

The <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe hath by our writers been long ſince obſerved, whereof from their writings you might eaſily have been enformed, had you deigned to conſult them: to wit, that in the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, works</hi> are conſidered, as in themſelves performed by the parties to be juſtified and <hi>to live,</hi> without reference unto ought done or to be done for them by any other: whereas in the <hi>Covenan of grace, Faith</hi> is required and conſidered, not as <hi>a work</hi> barely done by us, but as an <hi>inſtrument,</hi> or mean, whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> is apprehended, &amp; received, in whom is found, &amp; by whom that is done whereby Gods juſtice is ſatisfied, and life eternall meritoriouſly procured for us; that which carieth the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of all home to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now Sir, what a vaſt difference there is between theſe two may appear, if you will be but pleaſed to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113794:25"/> conſider, how farre theſe two <hi>propoſitions</hi> are aſunder, <hi>Pay your debt of a thouſand pounds, and be free;</hi> and, <hi>Rely on ſuch a friends ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made for it, and be as free as if you had made full payment and ſatisfaction your ſelf.</hi> He is either very dim-ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or wilfully wincks, that ſees not what diſtance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two agreements, and how they ſuit with the <hi>two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> that we to are <hi>diſtinguiſh:</hi> which Mr <hi>S.</hi> would here make to be a matter of ſo great difficulty that we muſt needs be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſed in it.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>new obedience;</hi> there is, as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and <hi>faith,</hi> in regard of its peculiar <hi>office,</hi> in this latter <hi>Covenant;</hi> ſo much more between them and <hi>works</hi> in the former.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Between them and <hi>faith,</hi> in the point of <hi>juſtification,</hi> or the diſcharge of a ſinner from the guilt of his ſinnes; for that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are both reqired as <hi>conditions</hi> to be neceſſarily perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all thoſe that expect life, or pardon of ſin, and ſalvation by Chriſt; yet neither of them comes in, as having any hand in the buſineſſe of our <hi>justification,</hi> or diſcharge of us from the guilt of our ſin; becauſe that neither do they caſt ought in toward the <hi>diſcharge</hi> of our <hi>debt,</hi> nor have they any peculiar <hi>act</hi> in the <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of, or ſpeciall <hi>relation</hi> unto, that whereby our <hi>debt</hi> is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</hi> Whereas our <hi>faith,</hi> tho it afford not the leaſt mite of it ſelf toward the making up of that <hi>price,</hi> wherewith our <hi>debt</hi> is to be <hi>diſcharged,</hi> yet it is that whereby we<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note>

            <p n="3">3. Grant that ſome things were afterward <hi>reveiled</hi> to them, wherewith at firſt they were not made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet</p>
            <p n="1">1. there was at the firſt ſo much <hi>reveiled</hi> to them, and <hi>preached</hi> by them, as was ſufficient to <hi>convert and ſave ſouls:</hi> for to what end elſe was their preaching?

               <hi>I thought hee had loved us too in himſelf: and from that love given Chriſt for us; and yet loved us in Chriſt too. Can any thing without God be a cauſe of Gods love,?

God is love, and therefore wee are made, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and ſanctified: not becauſe wee are ſanctified, therefore hee loves us.

            <p n="1">1. Grant it, that hee was <hi>blamed</hi> for the latter; that <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> of his, and the evill act thence proceeding, diſcovering the unſoundneſſe of his formerly pretended, and externally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>faith:</hi> yet what I ſay ſtands ſtill firm, That <hi>a man may too ſuddenly believ as hee did.</hi> And if his <hi>belief</hi> were <hi>unbelief,</hi> and a mere groundleſſe preſumption, then that which I ſay is true: For ſure it is, men may too ſuddenly <hi>miſ-believ</hi> and <hi>preſume.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

For may not therefore ſome perſwade themſelves, (and that from your grounds encouraged ſo to do) that Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belong to them, when indeed they do not?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Tho <hi>Chriſt cannot too ſoon be a Saviour,</hi> if hee pleaſe, unto any; yet may many, yea, too many do <hi>perſwade</hi> themſelves, that Chriſt is their Saviour, whom yet he never will ſave.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The fountain</hi> in ſome ſort and manner <hi>may,</hi> in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diſpenſation of it, <hi>be too ſoon ſet open;</hi> if it be otherwiſe ſet open then it was by <hi>Peter</hi> in his preaching<note n="r" place="margin">Acts 2.38. &amp; 3.19.</note> to the Jewes,

            <p n="6">6. <hi>The riches of Chriſt cannot too ſoon be brought home to any ſoul.</hi> It is God; not you, or I, or any other that can doe that.
